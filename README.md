# Learnweb-Downloader
This tool can be used to download resources from WWU MÃ¼nster courses.

If your teacher does not put the files into separate folders, one cannot download the course materials easily. With this tool, these files can be downloaded.

# Requirements
Please install the following packages in order to use this tool:
    requests
    bs4
    lxml

# Usage
You can use the tool the following way

    python3 LearnwebDownloader.py [ZIV-ID] [ZIV-Password] [Course-ID]

# Limitations
Right now, the tool only downloads .pdf files. However, this should be sufficient for the most tasks.
Otherwise, just adjust the line 55 of the sourcecode.
